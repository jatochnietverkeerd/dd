- **Impact**: Data type conflicts causing validation errors
- **Fix**: Updated schema to use `decimal` type for price field with proper precision

#### Issue #2: Missing Database Fields
- **Problem**: Database had `created_at` field but schema didn't include it
- **Impact**: Schema-database synchronization issues
- **Fix**: Added missing `createdAt` field to vehicles table schema

#### Issue #3: API Route Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Expected endpoints `/api/vehicles/:id/purchase` and `/api/vehicles/:id/sale` didn't exist
- **Impact**: API calls returning HTML instead of JSON

- **Impact**: Purchase and sale forms failing validation with type mismatches
- **Fix**: Rewrote schemas using direct `z.object()` with proper number-to-string transformations
